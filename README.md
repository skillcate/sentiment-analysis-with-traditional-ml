* With the power of internet, businesses today get huge number of customer feedbacks through their: business website, social media page, business listings, etc.
* However, majority of these businesses don't know how to use this information to improve themselves
* Natural Language Processing (NLP) based Sentiment Analysis models can predict sentiments for such unstructured reviews at scale
* In this project, we will prepare a Sentiment-based Review Classification Model end-to-end.
* We are using **Bag-of-Words (BoW) for Feature Representation** & **Naive Bayes for Classification**
